        <h1>What is Arch Linux?</h1>
        <p2 class="text-paragraph"
          >A simple, <strong>lightweight</strong>distribution.
          <strong> Arch Linux </strong>
          is an independent
          <strong> Linux </strong>
          distribution that adheres to the principles of
          <strong>
            simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility.
            It is a minimalist, lightweight, and bleeding edge distro targeting
            proficient GNU/Linux users
          </strong>
          over the idea of trying to be appealing to as many users as possible.
          <strong> Arch promotes the do-it-yourself </strong>
          (DIY) attitude among its users and thus provides you with the
          <strong> freedom to tweak your system </strong>
          according to your needs.</p2

        <h2>Advantages of Arch Linux:</h2>
        <p3>
          Arch Linux follows a rolling release model, this essentially means
          that you get all the new features and updates as soon as they roll
          out. There is no need for versions when updating and upgrading your
          system boils down to a simple command mentioned below.
        </p3>
        <ul>
          <li>pacman -Syu (to update your system)</li>

          <li>pacman -Rs (to delete software from your system)</li>

        <h3>The Holy Arch Wiki:</h3>
        <p4
          >Arch Linux is one of the, if not the most well documented Linux
          distros out there. The Arch wiki is the stuff of legends among the
          Linux enthusiasts. It is extremely well documented and massive. Its
          offerings extend beyond Arch Linux itself at times. If you run into
          some trouble with your system, the Arch Wiki probably has the solution
          already.</p4

      Although, you might find Arch to be a very likely contender for your next
      distro hop, let me remind you that it is not at all a newbie-friendly
      distro. It is not recommended that an absolute Linux newbie tries out
      Arch. With the amount of customizability Arch offers in question, it is
      highly likely that a new user might potentially break their system trying
      to configure it in a totally wrong way. If you really want to try out Arch
      and you are not confident with your Linux skills, it is a much better idea
      to try out the installation in a virtual machine and then make the jump on
      a real system once you are confident enough.
